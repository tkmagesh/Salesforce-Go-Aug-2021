Why Golang?
    1. Manage Memory
    2. Concurrency (Simplified)
    3. Functional

    1. Better performance
        - No runtime
        - compiled
        - on par with 'C' (without overhead of memory management)

    2. Simplicity
        - No classes (Only structs & functions)
        - No inheritance (Only composition)
        - No exceptions (Only error handling)
        - No access modifiers
        - No generics
        - ONLY 25 keywords
            package, func, var, type, struct, interface, return, if, else, switch, case, for, break, continue, bool, int, float, string, chan, map, slice, nil, true, false, go, select, fallthrough

    3. Simplified Concurrency
        - Builtin scheduler
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            go keyword
            chan datatype
            <- operator
            select, range constructs
        - 2 KB of memory per goroutine
        - thousands of goroutines can be scheduled in one OS thread
